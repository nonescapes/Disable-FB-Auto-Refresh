A simple, lightweight browser extension designed to prevent Facebook.com pages from automatically refreshing or redirecting to the homepage due to inactivity.

## Core Features

Many users encounter automatic page refreshes on Facebook after a period of inactivity, which can interrupt viewing content or ongoing conversations.

This extension "tricks" Facebook's idle detection mechanism by periodically simulating minor user activity (such as window focus, clicks, and scrolling) in the background, keeping the page active and effectively preventing auto-refresh.

**Features:**
- **Focused Core**: Only does one thing - prevents idle refreshing. No extra background processes or complex settings.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Extremely lean code with minimal impact on browser performance.
- **Pure Client-Side Operation**: All operations are performed locally in your browser, without collecting any user data.
- **Easy to Use**: Install and enable, no configuration required. Click the extension icon to view the current status.
